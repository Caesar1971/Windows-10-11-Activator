You can also run this in Powershell(Make sure to run it as Administrator)


```
irm https://get.activated.win | iex
```


COPY THE ABOVE CODE AND PASTE IT IN YOUR POWERSHELL



This is not required to run the code itself, it acts as a substitute to the .cmd file



Enjoy!!




One more thing!
It might say that this is harmful... but trust me, it's not the only reason it's marked as harmful is because it is related to KMS which
is marked as "Harmful"
The second reason is because it is  a ".cmd" format which is also marked to be harmful!!
